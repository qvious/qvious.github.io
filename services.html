	<h3>IM (Initial Margin)</h3>
	<p>
		Initial margin (IM) is intended to protect the non-defaulting counterparty against the loss that occurs if the cost of replacing (or closing out) the netting set of trades exceeds the amount of variation margin (VM) held.
		Each September until 2020, increasing numbers of entities will be required to meet initial margin regulations as the threshold level for compliance reduces.
		Qvious offers solid advice and systems that ensure to prepare these requirements.
	</p>
